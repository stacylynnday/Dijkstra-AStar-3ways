# Dijkstra-AStar-3ways

- This project uses Dijkstra's Algortihm and the AStar Algorithm to compute the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. There are three methods for each of these methods: shortest path using distance, shortest path by time using speed limits, and shortest path by time using speed limits and considering traffic. Sample maps are in the maps folder.
