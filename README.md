# Dijkstra-AStar-3ways

- This project uses Dijkstra's Algortihm and the AStar Algorithm to compute the shortest path between two geographic locations in a map. There are three methods for each of these algorithms: shortest path using distance, shortest path by time using speed limits, and shortest path by time using speed limits and considering traffic. Sample maps are in the maps folder.

- TODO: turn repeated code into methods. (Initializations and getNeighbors)
